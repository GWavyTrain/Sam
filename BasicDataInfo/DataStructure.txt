Contains snapshots 26-135, missing 53 and 55

Naming:
time_BHillustris1_XXX.dat, XXX is snapshot number

Structure of data files:

Col 1:  Illustris particle ID (15-17 digit integer)

Col 2:  Illustris particle initial mass at formation in units of 1e10 Msun/h, h = 0.704

Col 3:  Snapshot redshift

Col 4:  Illustris particle metallicity (as Z absolute values)

Col 5:  Metallicity of the simulated binary (as Z absolute values)

Col 6:  Identifier of the merging BH binary

Col 7:  Mass of the first BH in Msun (source frame)

Col 8:  Mass of the second BH in Msun (source frame), note that the second BH is not necessarily the less massive

Col 9:  Delay time (between formation of the stellar progenitor and coalescence of BH binary, in Gyr)

Col 10: BH binary merger time (as a look back time with respect to us, in Gyr)
