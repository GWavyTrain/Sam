Dear Kelly,

sorry for my long silence.

I have created for you an account on our server. you can  access it by typing

ssh -p1022 kelly@scighera.oapd.inaf.it


the password is pleasechangeme (to be changed immediately as you log in). please, let me know if you have problems with it



The files you are interested in are in

/data6MM/mapelli/Illustris-1/data_merging_BBH/Chen_upto150/CDS1e6/output/

names time_BHillustris1_i.dat

with i running from 26 to 135 (the number refers to the illustris snapshot)

These files contain all the merging BH binaries with their main properties for our fiducial model.


Inside each files there are 10 columns

col 1: illustris particle ID

col 2: illustris particle initial mass at formation in units of 1e10 Msun /hubble constant where hubble constant = 0.704

col 3: "current" redshift (i.e. redshift of the snapshot)

col 4: illustris particle metallicity (as Z absolute values)

col 5: metallicity of the simulated binary (as Z absolute values)

col 6: identifier of the merging BH binary

col 7: mass of the first BH in Msun (source frame)

col 8: mass of the second BH in Msun (source frame), note that the second BH is not necessarily the less massive

col 9: delay time (between formation of the stellar progenitor and coalescence of BH binary, in Gyr)

col 10: BH binary merger time (as a look back time with respect to us, in Gyr)



I think the best way to operate is that you copy the files time_BHillustris1_i.dat on your machines, but if you need some hard drive space in our machines, please, let us know.


Please, let me know if there is something unclear or missing in my information

sorry again for my delay

best

michela
